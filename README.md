# GLTECH-Bus-Map

## Project Description: 
Provides an animated map (using mapbox-gl) where a marker moves to show GLTECH's Bus #1's stops throughout Tyngsboro, MA.

## What does the current project do? 
It runs through the corrdinates run in an array and updates the marker to the next set of coordinates every 0.75 seconds until reaching the final destination (GLTECH).

## How to Run:

*Click the botton on the top left to start the animation

## Roadmap of future improvements: 
*Have marker show title of intersection and arrival time as it goes through each stop.
